# üõ†Ô∏è VPP Docker Runtime Setup

This GitHub Action configures the Docker runtime environment for VPP (Vector Packet Processing) testing by optimizing shared memory configuration. It's specifically designed to prepare the environment for VPP test execution with `make test`.

## Overview

The action addresses a critical requirement for VPP testing in containerized environments by reconfiguring the `/dev/shm` (shared memory) mount with sufficient space to handle VPP's memory requirements during test execution.

## Problem Solved

VPP tests require substantial shared memory allocation, particularly when running multiple test processes simultaneously. The default Docker shared memory size is often insufficient, causing test failures due to memory allocation errors. This action proactively addresses this limitation.

## Usage

```yaml
- name: Setup VPP Docker Runtime
  uses: fdio/.github/.github/actions/vpp-docker-runtime-setup
  with:
    TUI_LINE: "*******************************************************************"
```

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `TUI_LINE` | Delimiter line for TUI output formatting | No | `"*******************************************************************"` |

## What It Does

### üéØ **Core Functionality**
- **Shared Memory Resize**: Remounts `/dev/shm` with 2048MB (2GB) of space
- **VPP Test Optimization**: Ensures sufficient memory for multi-core VPP test execution
- **Error Tolerance**: Uses `|| true` to handle cases where remount might not be necessary
- **Visual Feedback**: Provides clear output with customizable formatting

### üßÆ **Memory Calculation**
The action uses a calculated memory size based on VPP's test framework requirements:

```
Memory Required = MIN_REQ_SHM + (num_cores √ó SHM_PER_PROCESS)
```

- **Base Memory**: 1073741824 bytes (1024MB) minimum required
- **Per-Core Addition**: Additional memory per CPU core
- **Total Allocation**: 2048MB for up to 16 cores (empirically determined)

## Technical Details

### Memory Sizing Logic
```bash
# Base calculation for 4 cores:
# framework.VppTestCase.MIN_REQ_SHM + (num_cores * framework.VppTestCase.SHM_PER_PROCESS)
# 1073741824 == 1024M (1073741824 >> 20)
# For 16 cores, empirical evidence shows that 2048M is sufficient
MEM=2048M
```

### Mount Operation
```bash
sudo mount -o remount /dev/shm -o size=${MEM} || true
```

- **Remount**: Modifies existing `/dev/shm` mount without unmounting
- **Size Option**: Sets new size limit for shared memory
- **Error Handling**: Continues execution even if remount fails (graceful degradation)

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **Linux Environment**: Requires Linux-based runner (Docker containers)
- **sudo Privileges**: Needs elevated permissions for mount operations
- **Existing /dev/shm**: Standard Linux shared memory filesystem must be present

### Runtime Context
- **Containerized Environment**: Designed for Docker-based CI/CD runners
- **VPP Source Code**: Should be used in workflows that build/test VPP
- **Test Execution**: Intended for workflows that run `make test`

## Example Workflows

### Basic VPP Test Workflow

```yaml
name: VPP Tests
on: push

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: ubuntu:22.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout VPP Source
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Dependencies
        uses: fdio/.github/.github/actions/vpp-install-ext-deps

      - name: Setup Docker Runtime for Tests
        uses: fdio/.github/.github/actions/vpp-docker-runtime-setup

      - name: Build VPP
        run: make build

      - name: Run VPP Tests
        run: make test
```

### Advanced Multi-Stage Workflow

```yaml
name: Comprehensive VPP CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  setup-and-test:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    container:
      image: vpp-build:latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Runtime Environment
        uses: fdio/.github/.github/actions/vpp-docker-runtime-setup
        with:
          TUI_LINE: "=== Docker Runtime Configuration ==="

      - name: Install External Dependencies
        uses: fdio/.github/.github/actions/vpp-install-ext-deps

      - name: Install Optional Dependencies
        uses: fdio/.github/.github/actions/vpp-install-opt-deps

      - name: Build VPP
        run: make build

      - name: Execute Test Suite
        run: make test

      - name: Performance Tests
        run: make test-debug
```

### Custom Configuration

```yaml
- name: Configure VPP Test Environment
  uses: fdio/.github/.github/actions/vpp-docker-runtime-setup
  with:
    TUI_LINE: "--- VPP Docker Runtime Setup ---"
```

## Memory Allocation Details

### Why 2048MB?

The 2048MB allocation is based on:

1. **VPP Framework Requirements**: Base shared memory needs for VPP test framework
2. **Multi-Core Support**: Additional memory per CPU core for parallel test execution
3. **Empirical Testing**: Validated through extensive testing with up to 16 cores
4. **Safety Margin**: Provides buffer for peak memory usage scenarios

### Scaling Considerations

| CPU Cores | Recommended Memory | Current Allocation | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| 1-4 cores | ~1024MB | 2048MB | ‚úÖ Sufficient |
| 5-8 cores | ~1500MB | 2048MB | ‚úÖ Sufficient |
| 9-16 cores | ~2000MB | 2048MB | ‚úÖ Sufficient |
| 16+ cores | >2048MB | 2048MB | ‚ö†Ô∏è May need adjustment |
